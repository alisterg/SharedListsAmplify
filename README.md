# Shopping

### Purpose

This is an app created with:

- React/Redux/TypeScript
- Ionic Framework
- AWS Amplify

It currently only works on iOS, but you could enable Android with basically a single command.

I made this app mainly to learn how to make an Alexa app. It enables the user to have a real-time-syncing grocery list, with arbitrary categories.

### Notes

To use this, you will need your own AWS account and credentials.
